🔄 Hybrid SRE Operating Model (Central + Embedded)

✅ Model Overview

In the hybrid model, the SRE function is split between:
	•	A Central SRE Team that:
	•	Builds and maintains core reliability frameworks, platforms, and tooling.
	•	Defines org-wide standards and best practices.
	•	Provides enablement, support, and guidance.
	•	Embedded or Local SREs/Dev Teams that:
	•	Integrate and operate those solutions within their domains.

Ownership & Responsibility Split
Component
Central SRE Team
Local Teams (or Embedded SREs)
Core Tooling (e.g., CI/CD, Monitoring)
Own, build, maintain
Integrate and provide feedback

🌟 Benefits of the Hybrid Model

🧠 Balanced Ownership
	•	Central team owns reusable infrastructure; product teams own reliability in their own stack.
	•	Prevents both bottlenecks and chaos.

🔍 Domain-Specific Reliability
	•	Local teams deeply understand their systems—can fine-tune reliability practices accordingly.
🔧 Who Owns Maintenance in the Hybrid Model?

1. Central SRE Team Owns Maintenance of:
	•	Core Platforms and Tools
Examples: CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging/monitoring stacks (

	•	The central SRE team maintains shared infrastructure (think of it as the “product” side of SRE). COre Part

	•	The product/feature teams maintain the usage and integration of that infrastructure in their own domain.
	•	Ownership is explicitly documented to avoid gaps and confusion.
